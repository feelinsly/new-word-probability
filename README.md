# new-word-probility
This python code applies _Probability of Acute Change Metric_ on Conversation Data to analyze probability of acute increase of new words in time-series conversation data.
The code is used to **analyze word use across time in group conversation data**. In particular, it examines the likelihood of forming or using new words at a certain time of point. The method is originally used to examine affective instability in Jahng et al., 2008 [Link](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-17368-004) and applied in our paper below:

# What does the code do to calculate Probability of Acute Change?

The code take this input of conversation data:

And it produces necessary outputs for caculating the probability of acute change (PAC) through this process:

Probability of Acute Change (PAC) represents the likelihood of acute changes across time, deâ€€ned by the number of acute changes divided by the total number of changes, which in our context is the acute increase of new words. The equation for iPAC
is:

where AC_i(t) = 1 when y_i(t+1)- y_i(t) >= c, c is a predetermined cut point (i.e., threshold), and AC_i(t) = 0 otherwise. The cut point was chosen by
sensitivity analysis and was the same across all individuals for a potential between-person comparison (Jahng et al., 2008). Put in another way, acute increases of new words in the participant's talking, as compared with his/her previous usage of words, indicates, what I call "change of design frame", or "evolution of design frame", or "frame adjustment".
